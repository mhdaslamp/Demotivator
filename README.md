### Project Description
Motivator is a playful website designed to motivate people with a twist. Instead of typical uplifting quotes, it offers funny, sarcastic, and sometimes brutally honest "demotivational" messages

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are tired of the same old positive, feel-good motivational quotes flooding their social media feeds

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing Motivator – the only website bold enough to tell you that, yes, sometimes you’re just procrastinating, and maybe today isn’t your day. Instead of sugarcoating, we’re serving up sassy, sarcastic, and hilariously blunt "demotivational" quotes designed to make you laugh, roll your eyes, or maybe even think, "Okay, maybe I can actually get through this.
